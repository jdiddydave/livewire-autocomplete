# Basic search select

The most common a Livewire autocomplete is used for is creating a searchable select input.

This means that results can be shown  and filted based on what the user has typed in the input.

As an example, lets create a user search select, which will allow us to search through existing users and select one of them.

**Complete example of a user search blade view**
```blade
<x-autocomplete auto-select wire:model.live="userId">
	<x-autocomplete-input wire:model.live="search" :disabled="$userId" />

	<x-autocomplete-list class="max-h-56">
		@foreach ($this->users as $user)
			<x-autocomplete-item :key="$user->id" :value="$user->name">
				{{ $user->name }}
			</x-autocomplete-item>
		@endforeach
	</x-autocomplete-list>
</x-autocomplete>
```

**Complete example of a user search component class**
```php
class UsersList extends Component
{
    public $search = '';
    public $userId = null;

    #[Computed]
    public function users()
    {
        return User::orderBy('name')
            ->when(
                $this->search,
                fn ($query, $value) => $query->where('name', 'like', "%{$value}%")
            )
            ->get();
    }
}
```

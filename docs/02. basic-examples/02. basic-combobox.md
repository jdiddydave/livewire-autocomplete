# Basic combobox

Another common use for the Livewire autocomplete component is as a combobox.

This allows users to search for and select existing records, and it also allows users to create a new record based on the data entered into the input.

As an example, lets create a user combobox, which will allow us to search through existing users and select one of them. It will also allow us to enter the name of a user that doesn't exist so a new user can be created later.
## Component
### Blade view
```blade
<x-autocomplete auto-select wire:model.live="userId">
    <x-autocomplete.input wire:model.live="search" :disabled="$userId">
        <x-autocomplete.clear-button />
    </x-autocomplete.input>

    <x-autocomplete.list class="max-h-56">
        @foreach ($this->users as $user)
            <x-autocomplete.item :key="$user->id" :value="$user->name">
                {{ $user->name }}
            </x-autocomplete.item>
        @endforeach
    </x-autocomplete.list>
</x-autocomplete>
```
### Component class
```php
use App\Models\User;
use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;
use Livewire\Component;

class UsersList extends Component
{
    public $search = '';
    public $userId = null;

    #[Computed]
    public function users()
    {
        return User::orderBy('name')
            ->when(
                $this->search,
                fn ($query, $value) => $query->where('name', 'like', "%{$value}%")
            )
            ->get();
    }
}
```
